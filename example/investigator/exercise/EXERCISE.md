# Module 7 Project: Investigator Agent

**System Context:**

The Investigator Agent is part of the Release Confidence System team that helps build confidence in software releases by investigating changes, assessing risks, and producing actionable reports. This agent inspects the state of a feature and determines if it is sufficiently prepared to be promoted to the next stage of development. For example, from the Development environment to UAT, or from UAT to production.

Your task is to build the Investigator Agent. What follows is the agent's acceptance criteria. The agent can be built using any tools you like. We recommend building it from scratch at first using your favorite programming language and coding assistant, but you can also use a popular SDK, such as LangChain, PydanticAI, and CrewAI, or even a no-code solution such as n8n.

If you're following our recommendation, you'll find instructions for using `DESIGN.md` and `STEPS.md` after the acceptance criteria that will (hopefully) make things easier for you.

## Building an agent using an SDK

This process has 2 main parts:
1. Create the implementation plan
2. Iteratively follow the steps in the plan

Everything you and your assistant need to know to implement the Investigator Agent is in `DESIGN.md`. We also recommend a specific order when adding features to your agent. Inside `STEPS.md` you'll find an order of implementation that mirrors the acceptance criteria above and builds incrementally on your Module 7 Detective Agent.

We've also provided `PLAN.md` which is an example starter file that a Python developer might use. Feel free to edit this file according to your preferences and language choice. Once you're happy with it, you're ready to begin.

## Test Data

**Important:** The test data is already provided in the `data/incoming/` directory. You do NOT need to create it.

The test data includes **4 features** with different readiness scenarios:

| Feature | Complexity | Stage | Readiness | Description |
|---------|-----------|-------|-----------|-------------|
| **Maintenance Scheduling & Alert System** | Medium | Production-Ready | ✅ READY | Clear success case - all gates passed, complete docs, green metrics |
| **QR Code Check-in/out with Mobile App** | High | Development/UAT | ❌ NOT READY | Multiple blockers - clear failures in testing and implementation |
| **Advanced Resource Reservation System** | High | UAT | 🔄 AMBIGUOUS | Mixed signals - incomplete data, requires judgment |
| **Contribution Tracking & Community Credits** | Medium-High | UAT | 🔄 PARTIAL | Right stage but not ready for next - some gaps remain |

Each feature in `data/incoming/featureN/` includes:
- `jira/`: JIRA metadata (feature_issue.json, issue_changelog.json)
- `metrics/`: 5 different JSON metric files
  - performance_benchmarks.json
  - pipeline_results.json
  - security_scan_results.json
  - test_coverage_report.json
  - unit_test_results.json
- `reviews/`: 3 different JSON review files
  - security.json
  - stakeholders.json
  - uat.json
- `planning/`: Multiple markdown documentation files (10+ files per feature)
  - ARCHITECTURE.md (large, >10KB)
  - DESIGN_DOC.md (large, >10KB)
  - DATABASE_SCHEMA.md (large)
  - DEPLOYMENT_PLAN.md, TEST_STRATEGY.md, USER_STORIES.md, etc.

**Total data size:** Approximately 1+ MB across all features

The data is synthetic, but intentionally realistic and specifically designed to challenge the agent's decision-making and context management capabilities.

## Steps

### Step 1: Create the implementation plan

The first step is to create the plan you're going to use going forward. Here is an example prompt you can use to create it. Feel free to modify it before using it.

```
Read @PLAN.md and follow your additional instructions inside it. I would like to use OpenRouter as the first provider.
```

Review the plan it created:
- Are the tasks broken down to sufficient detail to avoid overwhelm during implementation?
- Does it follow the same STEPS order?
- Did it add or remove any sections?
- Briefly look over the code - anything unusual?

You may need to collaborate with your assistant to get the planning doc where you're happy with it.

### Step 2: Iterate over the steps in the plan

This is where you get to decide how much you want to bite off at a time. Hopefully the plan is already broken down well enough. When you're considering the next piece of work, if it doesn't have enough detail, or if it needs to be broken down further, work with your assistant to update PLAN.md until you're happy with what you know it's going to build, or happy enough with the mystery ;)

Here is an example prompt that is a good one to start each step with. Sometimes it may be enough for your assistant to finish it, sometimes it will require some back and forth. Start over if it's too far off at the beginning.

#### Remember to: START EACH STEP WITH A NEW ASSISTANT SESSION

```
Please complete step 1.1 in @PLAN.md. Refer to the appropriate section in @DESIGN.md to ensure you're meeting all of the acceptance criteria.
```

Don't be satisfied with all green on your test run. Test it manually. Make sure you can see what you expect to see in the traces (responses, errors, tool calls, sub-conversations, context compression, memory operations, etc). Have your assistant create CLI interfaces so you can _verify_ everything is actually working.

#### Remember to: STAGE/COMMIT THE WORKING TREE

After each major step, commit your working code:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Step X.Y: [description]"
```

This gives you safe rollback points if needed.

### Step-by-Step Workflow

The recommended progression (detailed in `STEPS.md`):

1. **Step 1: Add JIRA Tool**
   - Create test data structure
   - Implement get_jira_data tool
   - Update system prompt
   - Verify end-to-end

2. **Step 2: Add Analysis Tool**
   - Understand analysis test data (8 types: 5 metrics + 3 reviews)
   - Implement get_analysis tool
   - Update system prompt with Phase 2 guidance
   - Verify multi-analysis assessment

3. **Step 3: Add Documentation Tools**
   - Understand documentation test data (planning/ folders)
   - Implement list_docs tool (scans planning/ directory)
   - Implement read_doc tool (reads markdown files)
   - Update system prompt
   - Observe context window pressure (motivates Step 4)

4. **Step 4: Add Sub-Conversation Context Management**
   - Design SubConversation data model
   - Implement sub-conversation manager
   - Integrate into agent core
   - Update observability for sub-conversations
   - Verify context management with large docs

5. **Step 5: Add Memory System (Optional)**
   - Choose memory approach
   - Design memory schema
   - Implement memory operations
   - Integrate into agent workflow
   - Verify memory learning

6. **Step 6: Add Evaluation System**
   - Design evaluation test cases
   - Implement evaluation dimensions
   - Implement evaluation runner
   - Implement regression tracking
   - Verify evaluation system

7. **Step 7: Final Integration and Polish**
   - End-to-end testing
   - Performance review
   - Documentation
   - Final evaluation run

### Verification Guidelines

For each step:

- ✅ **Run automated tests** - Ensure code quality
- ✅ **Run manual CLI tests** - Verify actual behavior
- ✅ **Check traces** - Ensure observability is capturing everything
- ✅ **Verify tokens** - Ensure context management is working
- ✅ **Test edge cases** - Missing data, errors, large files

Don't move to the next step until the current step is fully working.

### When You're Done

Repeat until Investigator Agent is ready for duty:

> _All of the acceptance criteria are met_

The agent should be able to:
- Accept natural language queries about feature readiness
- Identify the feature and gather all relevant data (JIRA, metrics, docs)
- Manage context effectively using sub-conversations for large content
- Make sound decisions with clear justifications
- Remember past assessments (if memory implemented)
- Pass comprehensive evaluations (>70% success rate)

:)

## Tips for Success

1. **Build incrementally** - Each step adds one capability
2. **Verify thoroughly** - Don't skip manual testing
3. **Watch your tokens** - Context management is critical here
4. **Use traces** - They show what's really happening
5. **Commit often** - Safe rollback points are invaluable
6. **Test with real scenarios** - The test data should challenge the agent
